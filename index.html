                        * If HTML is the bread and butter of a web page, then CSS is our butter knife.
                        * Why is CSS the knife? Well, it controls what goes where. Using CSS we declare how we'd like the content (HTML) to be
                        presented. CSS stands for Cascading Stylesheets. The key word here is "style", referring to the way something looks.
